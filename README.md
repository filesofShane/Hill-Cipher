# Hill-Cipher
Python, NumPy, SymPy, Jupyter Notebook

This is a Hill Cipher project I did in my 2nd Year. It involves:
- Using a 3x3 matrix taking a word and splitting it up into parts of 3s.
- Multiplying the letters with the matrix to encrypt them (This turns the letters to numbers).
- Multiplying the numbers with the key matrix (mod 26), turning them back into letters (Encryption).
- And using the inverse key to decrypt the encryption.
